Project: Design and construct a functional RC Dyno using an arduino board and create a GUI and csv file to display the data in a human readable format using serial ports. Should find volt, current, power, torque, load, etc.

Includes imports: tkinter and playsound.


obviously lighting mcqueen themed


For Arduino Code: we used a special library from Adafruit to output volt, current, and power using the INA219 board (made by Adafruit). Everything else is coded normally using C in the Arduino IDE. 

Our board is Arduino Uno r4 WiFi
